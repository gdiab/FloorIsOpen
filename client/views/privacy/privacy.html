			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Updated: September 29th,  2014</p>
			<p> This Privacy Policy  describes OpenFloor&rsquo;s policies and procedures on the collection, use and  disclosure of your information when you use the OpenFloor Service. We will not  use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy  Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other  means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not  defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our&nbsp;<a href="http://openfloor.co/terms">Terms of Service</a>.  By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
			<p>OpenFloor uses  information we collect to operate, maintain and provide you the features and  functionality of the Service, to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose  service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember  information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate  metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns,  and track Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act and other applicable laws.</p>
			<p>Information You Provide:&nbsp;You  provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if  you register for an account with the Service, including by connecting with the  Service via a third-party service, or by &ldquo;following,&rdquo; &ldquo;becoming a fan,&rdquo; adding  the OpenFloor application, etc., on a third party website or network. Your  name, email address and other information you choose to provide on the Service  will be viewable and discoverable by other users, in accordance with your  settings on the Service.</p>
			<p>We may use your email  address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by  law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). We may also use your contact  information to send you marketing messages. If you don&rsquo;t want to receive these  messages, you can opt out by following the instructions in the message. If you  correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages,  your email address and our responses.</p>
			<p>If you choose to use our  invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that  person&rsquo;s email address and automatically send an email invitation. OpenFloor  stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your  invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.</p>
			<p>Content:&nbsp;You also  provide us information in Content you post to the Service. Your Content and metadata  about your Content may be viewed by other users in accordance with your  settings on the Service. OpenFloor can, but has no obligation, to monitor your</p>
			<p>Content you post on the Service. We can remove any information you post for any  reason or no reason. Unless Content is made viewable in accordance with your  settings on the Service, OpenFloor and OpenFloor employees will not view your  Content except: (i) to maintain, provide or improve the Service; (ii) to help  you and resolve your support requests; or (iii) as OpenFloor believes, in its  sole opinion, is necessary to comply with or avoid the violation of applicable  law or regulation or to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>
			<p>Cookies:&nbsp;When you  use the Service, we may send one or more &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; – a small data file – to  your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let OpenFloor help you log  in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey  anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A persistent  cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can  be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies  can be removed by following your web browser&rsquo;s directions. A session cookie is  temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web  browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability  to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
			<p>Log Files:&nbsp;When you  use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information sent by  your web browser. These server logs may include information such as your web  request, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages  and</p>
			<p>URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service,  domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such  information.</p>
			<p>Clear Gifs Information:&nbsp;When  you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which  are used to track the online usage patterns. In addition, we may also use clear  gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by  recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make OpenFloor  better for our users.</p>
			<p>Geo-Location  Information:&nbsp;When you use the Service by or through a mobile device, we  may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store &ldquo;location data,&rdquo; which may  include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information  regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey  information about how you browse the Service to us. Location data does not  collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location  data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some  features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function  properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>
			<p>Device Identifiers:&nbsp;When  you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect,  monitor and/or remotely store one or more &ldquo;device identifiers.&rdquo; Device  identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or  associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and  are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in  connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the  device&rsquo;s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.  A device identifier may convey information about how you use the Service to us.  A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable  information about you. A device identifier may be used in conjunction with  personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain  persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your  navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function  properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled.  OpenFloor may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling OpenFloor&rsquo;s  Services.</p>
			<p>Third Party Tools:&nbsp;OpenFloor  uses third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand  use of the Service. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your  browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address.</p>
			<p>These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is  governed by their privacy policy.</p>
			<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
			<p>Your Use:&nbsp;We will  display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the  Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information  you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about  you.</p>
			<p>Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile  page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your  profile information at any time. We may also share or disclose your information  with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access  your account (see below).</p>
			<p>Service Providers,  Business Partners, and Others:&nbsp;OpenFloor may share your personally  identifiable information with other third parties for the purpose of providing  the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties&rsquo; use of your information  will be bound by this</p>
			<p>Privacy Policy. We may also store personal information in  locations outside the direct control of OpenFloor (for instance, on servers or  databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
			<p>Business Transfers:&nbsp;As  we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.  Customers, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred  business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign  such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or  dissolution.</p>
			<p>Third Party Services:&nbsp;We  may share your information with a third party application with your consent,  for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application.  We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you  should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy  acceptable to you.</p>
			<p>Compliance with Laws and  Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of OpenFloor&rsquo;s Rights:&nbsp;OpenFloor may  disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or  if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation  or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud,  security or technical issues; or to protect OpenFloor&rsquo;s rights or property.</p>
			<p>Non-Personally  Identifiable Information:&nbsp;We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or  otherwise non-personally identifiable information, such as anonymous usage  data, platform types, etc., with interested third parties to help them  understand the usage patterns for certain OpenFloor Services.</p>
			<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
			<p>The security of your  information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a  credit card number) as part of our service, we encrypt the transmission of that  information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
			<p>OpenFloor uses  commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to  preserve the integrity and security of your personal information, once we  receive it. For example, we continuously and regularly back up your data to  help prevent data loss and aid in data recovery. We also guard against common  web attack vectors and implement access restrictions on our servers to secure  our network and better protect your information. No method of electronic  transmission of storage is 100% secure, however, and we cannot ensure or  warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit or store in the  Service.</p>
			<p>In the event that  personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, OpenFloor  will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been  compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this  Privacy</p>
			<p>Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
			<p>If you have any  questions about security on our Service, you can contact us at security@OpenFloor.co</p>
			<h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
			<p>You may, of course,  decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in  which case OpenFloor may not be able to provide certain services to you. You  may update or correct your account information at any time by logging in to  your account.</p>
			<h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
			<p>Protecting the privacy  of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to  persons under 13. OpenFloor does not knowingly collect or solicit personal  information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to  register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal  information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent,  we take steps to remove that information. If you believe that we might have any  information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@OpenFloor.co.</p>
			<h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
			<p>We may transfer  information that we collect about you, including personal information, to  affiliated entities, or to other third parties (as provided herein) across  borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or  jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or  other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from  U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information, including personal  information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data  protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of  information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you,  including personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
			<p>We are not responsible  for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the  information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a  link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer  in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those  that have a link on our website, is subject to that website&rsquo;s own rules and  policies.</p>
			<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>If we change our Privacy  Policy, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what  information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may  disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted  on this page.</p>
